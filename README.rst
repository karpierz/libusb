======

Python binding for the *libusb* C library.

Overview
========

| Python |package_bold| module is a low-level binding for *libusb* C library.
| It is an effort to allow python programs full access to the API implemented
  and provided by the well known `*libusb* <https://libusb.info/>`__ library.

`PyPI record`_.

`Documentation`_.

| |package_bold| is a lightweight Python package, based on the *ctypes* library.
| It is fully compliant implementation of the original C *libusb* 1.0 API
  by implementing whole its functionality in a clean Python instead of C.
|
| *libusb* API 1.0 documentation can be found at:

  `libusb-1.0 API Reference <http://api.libusb.info>`__

|package_bold| uses the underlying *libusb* C shared library as specified in
libusb.cfg (included libusb-X.X.* is the default), but there is also ability
to specify it programmatically by one of the following ways:

.. code:: python

  import libusb
  libusb.config(LIBUSB="libusb C shared library absolute path")
  # or
  libusb.config(LIBUSB=None)  # included libusb-X.X.* will be used

**libusb** - A cross-platform user library to access USB devices

**Overview**

**libusb** is a C library that provides generic access to USB devices.
It is intended to be used by developers to facilitate the production of
applications that communicate with USB hardware.

It is **portable**: Using a single cross-platform API, it provides access
to USB devices on Linux, OS X, Windows, Android, OpenBSD, etc.

It is **user-mode**: No special privilege or elevation is required for the
application to communicate with a device.

It is **version-agnostic**: All versions of the USB protocol, from 1.0 to 3.1
(latest), are supported.

**What platforms are supported?**

Linux, OS X, Windows, Windows CE, Android, OpenBSD/NetBSD, Haiku.
